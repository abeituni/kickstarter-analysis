# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Our project focuses in on Kickstarter Theater & Play campaigns. We use our data to assess how each of these campaigns fared.
### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to analyze and determine the outcomes of campaigns. From our analysis we can determine trends and come to a conclusion regarding the data provided.
## Analysis and Challenges
Our two deliverables focused on a Parent Category & Subcategory; Theater campaigns & plays. Louise needed us to assess each campaigns launch date & funding goals to determine any trends based off our findings. I did not incur any challenges pulling & analyzing the data.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
61% of all Theater campaigns were successful, a very high success rate in comparison to other categories. The month of May had the largest number of campaigns launched, with June closely trailing it. In addition, these months had the highest percentages of success throughout the year. December was the worst month for campaigns to launch, resulting in success and failure rates looking nearly identical.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Looking at this data there were a few things that stood out. First & foremost, the lower the goal amount for these Play campaigns, the higher success rate they would see. Over 70% of campaigns with a goal of less than $5000 were successful. On the flip side, over 90% of campaigns failed when their goal was over the $45,000 mark. Interestingly enough, 66% of Play campaigns were successful when setting a goal between $35000-$4499.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not encounter and challenges or difficulties analyzing this data. If someone was unfamiliar with CountIFS formulas; analyzing this data would be very difficult for them based off the large amounts of data.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The first conclusion would be that your highest chance of launching a successful campaign would be in the middle of the year; preferably May & June. The second conclusion you can draw from this data is to avoid launching a campaign at the end of the year. This could be because business are budgeting their spending at the end of the fiscal year and households are spending their money on other things.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
If you want to play it safe, aim for a low goal amount for your campaign. Over 70% of campaigns with a goal of less than $5000 were successful. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We did not analyze the types of plays these campaigns were about. We also did not analyze Live campaigns to see what their data looked like. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
One chart we can create would be looking at the campaign duration versus the success rate. In addition, we can create a chart analyzing the launch date and goals set. We'd be able to see if there was a period of time when campaigns were requesting more funding.
